# Tree

## Final project for CS 174A, Introduction to Computer Graphics, UCLA WINTER 2022
## Created by Aditya Mishra, Ethan Ngo, Jillian Pantig

### Proposal and Basic Info:

* Our proposal is an interactive outdoor environment focused on a tree. We plan to implement shading and shadows to the trees and leaves for our advanced feature. The interactive element would be user camera interactivity with panning around the scene as well as zooming into a specific tree for closer details.

We will have a day and night cycle, as well as season changes. If time permits, we would take user input via the mouse. By clicking on a button, trees would sway and some number of pinecones would fall to the ground, simulating a tree being shaken. In addition, we may add rain to the scene.

### User Interaction:

- Buttons allow a user to change the seasons, make the trees sway a little, and focus on a single tree. In addition, there is camera panning abilities to look at the entire scene.

### Topics Covered

- Texture Mapping and Scrolling
- Shading
- Camera Interactivity
- Shadowing (Advanced)
- Physics-based Rain Simulation (Advanced and if time permits)

### How to Use

1. Clone this [repository](https://github.com/pjil127/Tree.git). 
2. Open with WebStorm or your preferred web development IDE.
3. Run index.html.
4. Using the buttons on the dashboard or the keys mapped to specific actions, you can:
   * Move the camera around with 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D', 'Z', space, ',', or '.' and click and drag to turn the camera.
   * Reset the camera.
   * Attach to a specified tree.
   * Change the season during day time.
   * Make the trees sway slightly with 'M'.
